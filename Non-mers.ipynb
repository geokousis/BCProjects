    "- **Step 1: Reading and Cleaning the Genome**  \n",
    "  The function reads the file and concatenates the sequence, running in **O(n)** time, where *n* is the length of the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2: Extracting k-mers from the Genome**  \n",
    "  It extracts all k-mers (substrings of length *k*) from the genome using a set comprehension. This process also runs in approximately **O(n)** time since it iterates through the sequence once. Stolen from [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/christoforos-nikolaou/BC205/blob/master/Classes/Chapter_02_Sequence_Analysis.html).\n",
    "- **Step 3: Generating All Possible k-mers**  \n",
    "  All possible k-mers are generated using `itertools.product`, which produces **4^k** combinations. For *k = 10*, this is **1048576** possible k-mers, so this step is **O(4^k)**. Stolen from [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/christoforos-nikolaou/BC205/blob/master/Classes/Chapter_02_Sequence_Analysis.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4: Computing the Non-kmers**  \n",
    "  The function computes the non-kmers as the difference between all possible list k-mers and those found in the genome, this step is also approximately **O(4^k)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the time complexity of the current method is **O(n + 4^k)**, which is efficient since it utilizes hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative \"Reverse Logic\" Approach - no hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead of using hashing, the function could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate all available k-mers (O(4^k)).**\n",
    "2. **For each k-mer, search through the genome to check if it exists.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reverse logic, each k-mer would be checked against the genome, and a naive search through the genome for a substring can take **O(n)** time per k-mer. This approach would result in a time complexity of **O(4^k * n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with *k = 10*, there would be 1048576 k-mers, and for each one, scanning the genome would be required. This would be significantly less efficient compared to the hash-based approach, making it impossible to run (for k=10 and other big k).\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Method:**  \n",
    "  Uses set and hashing logic to extract k-mers efficiently with a total complexity of **O(n + 4^k)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reverse Logic Alternative:**  \n",
    "  Would require checking each of the **4^k** possible k-mers against the genome, resulting in a much higher complexity of **O(4^k * n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current method is clearly preferable in terms of computational efficiency, especially as the value of *k* increases.\n",
